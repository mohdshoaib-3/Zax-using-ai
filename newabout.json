I attempt to ask the correct questions of my students instead of providing them with the answers, and with the aid of group projects and demonstrations, they ought to be able to do so. I believe that the younger generation lacks innovation and critical thinking. I work to support their development of these skills, which is why I favor coaching over lecturing. Simply put, I work to better equip my students for the difficulties they will encounter in the job market. Effective teaching and learning tactics are those that are founded on data, applied consistently, and result in long-lasting improvements in every student. My teaching approach is best characterized as participatory, encouraging, and open. Regardless of their level of confidence, I encourage all of my students to speak up in class, ask questions when they have them, and take an active part in all discussions. Coming to my teaching style I will use ppts or depends on student interest I can make the student easy to understand the subject in very easiest way. I can provide good material and files regarding subject. I am a Strong analytical, logical and statistical skill with ability to analyse the hidden patterns and trends in large data sets. Teacher play such an important part in shaping and guiding the students."
